1. Introduction

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is one of the largest IT companies in India and a global leader in technology services. Its stock is traded on the Indian stock exchanges and has been one of the most stable and rewarding stocks for long-term investors.

The aim of this project is to study TCS stock data over time and understand how the stock has performed in terms of price growth, dividends, stock splits, and company fundamentals.

The main objectives are:

- To analyze the historical price trends and growth patterns of TCS stock.
- To check how dividends and stock splits have impacted investors and market activity.
- To find which years gave the best returns for investors.
- To measure how volatile TCS stock has been during major global and local events.
- To see whether company fundamentals (like revenue growth, margins, etc.) support the stockâ€™s performance.
- To evaluate how TCS has rewarded its shareholders overall.

These objectives are important because they help both investors and the company. Investors can decide whether TCS is a good stock to buy or hold, while the company can understand how its financial policies (like dividend payouts or splits) affect its market perception.

2. Data Cleaning

- Checked for missing values in all three datasets (history, actions, info).
- Found missing values mainly in company fundamentals (info file).
- Replaced missing textual values with "Unknown" and numeric gaps with suitable averages/forward fill.
- Converted the Date column to datetime format for proper time series analysis.
- Created new columns like Daily Returns and Year for deeper analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Price trend analysis: line charts of stock price growth since 2002.
- Dividend and stock split patterns over time.
- Annual return calculations to find best/worst performing years.
- Volatility check during events like the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID.
- Comparison of dividends vs company fundamentals (profit margins, revenues).
- Analyst recommendations and whether they match historical performance.

4. Limitations

- Fundamental data (info.csv) had missing values, so analysis may not be fully complete.
- Dataset may not include all macroeconomic events that affect stock price.
- Analyst recommendation data is limited and may not reflect full market opinion.
- Results are historical and may not guarantee future stock performance.

5. Recommendations

- TCS should continue with a stable dividend policy as it attracts long-term investors.
- Stock splits in the past helped improve affordability; similar actions may help increase participation in the future.
- Investors should look at both price appreciation and dividends for evaluating returns.
- Compare TCS with peer IT companies (like Infosys, Wipro, HCL) for a clearer picture in future studies.

6. Conclusion

This analysis shows that TCS has been a strong wealth creator for investors over the years. The stock has grown steadily, provided regular dividends, and survived major crises with resilience. While some gaps exist in data, overall, TCS stock reflects both business strength and investor trust.
